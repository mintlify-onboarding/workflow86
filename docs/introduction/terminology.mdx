## Other useful terms

These terms aren't essential, but you might find these terms useful when using Workflow86.

### Development

Development basically describes everything before the workflow goes live or is launched into the real world. It can also be referred to as the Draft state of a workflow. When you are building a workflow on the canvas, you are in development. The stage after development is production.

### Production

Production is the live or launched state of a workflow - it means the workflow is out in the real world, being used. When you publish a workflow, it goes into production.
