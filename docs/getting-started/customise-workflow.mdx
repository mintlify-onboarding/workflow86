## ‚úÖ Add a new question to the form

Let‚Äôs start by adding a new question into the form. Drop in an upload media question. This allows you to upload files from the form, and then have a link to that file passed through to other components. Insert "Upload a file here" as the question.

Save your changes to the form and exit back to the canvas.

## ‚úÖ Add a new component to the workflow

Drop a document editor component into the canvas.

Connect the form to the input node of the document editor.

## ‚úÖ Configure the document editor

Click into the document editor. Type "Here is a link to the uploaded file" and then insert the placeholder from the upload media question right after it. You can find the placeholder for the upload media question on the right hand side - search for UploadMedia if you can't find it.

Save and exit the document editor back to the canvas. Connect the document editor to the email.

## ‚úÖ Configure the email

Click into the email component. If you look on the right hand placeholders menu and search "Document", you will see that the document editor now passes a placeholder to the email. This placeholder represents the URL link to the document generated when the workflow is run. Insert that placeholder somewhere into the email body.

Save and exit the email and then publish the project again to deploy the changes we just made.

## ‚úÖ Start your new workflow

Click ‚ÄúStart workflow‚Äù and complete the form as before. Don't forget to upload a file when you reach the upload file question which we inserted earlier.

## ‚úÖ Check the outputs

Once you have submitted the form, you will have received an email which now contains a link to the document generated by the document editor.

Return back to the canvas and click ‚ÄúFiles‚Äù in the toolbar on top of the canvas.

![](/images/edit8-59e9d2670f94dade768c2dd4a095b1ac.png)

This will bring you to the File Library for your workflow. In the uploaded tab, you will find the file that you uploaded to the form.

Click on the generated tab - here you will find the document that was generated during the workflow.
